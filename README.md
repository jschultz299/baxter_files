# baxter_files

Make sure to have a catkin workspace set up first.

File structure should look like this

catkin_ws
- build
- devel
- logs
- src
    - baxter
    - baxter_common
    - baxter_examples
    - baxter_interface
    - baxter_tools
- baxter.sh

To do this easily, clone this repo into fresh catkin_ws and rename to src. Then, move baxter.sh and .bashrc.
